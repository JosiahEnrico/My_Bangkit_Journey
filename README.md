# My_Bangkit_Journey
This is actually whole daily and weekly reports that I submit everyday to KampusMerdeka. You know what? I'm going to be a startup developer. I believe that what I will learn here in Bangkit would help me to build better app that support my future Startup. So, wish me luck!!

   I haven't finished my first course about starting programming with Kotlin, so today learned data classes, functional programming, and OOP within Kotlin which is honestly quite exhausting.  Nevertheless, it's fun though.

   Today, I learned the last two modules of starting programming with Kotlin, Generics, and Coroutines. The module feels not as hard as yesterday since we don't deal with much programming logic expression but it's still confusing though. Planning to get the test done tomorrow morning.

   Well, it's such a bad day but it is not completely a disaster. Today I finished making a note summary of all I have learned in the first topic about Kotlin Programming and we have our first Instructor-Led Training in the evening. The matter arises when I realize that my code for final submission can't be inspected because I have the wrong setup for the software (IntelliJ IDEA), this cost me my first Bangkit Certificate Submission that is due this midnight. However, I managed to get everything fixed a little late after midnight and can sleep well bus still it is a pain in the ass T_T
